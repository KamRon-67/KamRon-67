<br />I'm a software developer focused on front-end development and passionate about the problem solving and creative aspects of development. Having graduating with an electronic enginnering degree I decided to take some time out to travel and later discovered a passion for coding. I am now on the path of pursuing a career in this field that is constantly expanding with new and interesting topics to learn.
